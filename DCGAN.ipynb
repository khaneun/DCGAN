    "*Learning reusable feature representations from large unlabeled datasets has been an area of active research. In the context of computer vision, one can leverage the prectically unlimited amount of unlabeled images and videos to learn good intermediate representations, which can then be used on a variety of supervised learning tasks such as image classifiacation. *\n",
    "\n",
    "*We propose that one way to build good image representations is by training Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs, Goodfellow et al, 2014), and later reusing parts of the generator and discriminator networks as feature extractors for supervised tasks. GANs provide an attractive alternative to maximum likelihood techniques. *\n",

    "*One can additionally argue that their learning process and the lack of a heuristic cost function (such as pixel-wise independent mean-square error) are attractive to representation learning. <span style=\"color:red\"> GANs have been known to be unstable to train, often resulting in generators that produce nonsensical outputs. </span> There has been very limited published research in tyring to understand and visualize what GANs learn, and the intermediate representations of multi-layer GANs. *\n"
